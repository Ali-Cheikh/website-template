# How to Build an SEO-Friendly Website Structure

If you want to increase the visibility of your website in search engines, having an SEO-friendly website structure is crucial. It not only helps search engines crawl and index your website more efficiently, but it also makes it easier for users to navigate and find the content they are looking for. However, building an SEO-friendly website structure can be a daunting task, especially if you are new to SEO. In this blog post, we will guide you through the process of building efficient website architecture, from understanding the basics of SEO to implementing best practices for website architecture. So, whether you are starting a new website or looking to improve your existing one, this guide will help you create a website that is optimized for both search engines and users.

## What is a Website Structure?

The way your website’s pages are linked to one another via internal links and their hierarchy is your site’s structure. It’s how your website’s content is laid out so that the algorithm can easily understand its context. Your website’s SEO ranking in search engines will rise because a well-structured website makes it simple for users and crawlers to navigate. By making it simple for users to locate the information they are looking for, a well-designed website structure increases its usability or user-friendliness.

To improve the structure of your website, you can make use of taxonomies like categories and tags, as well as internal links, navigation, and breadcrumbs. Users will have an easier time navigating your website if you do this well. Additionally, Google can better index your URLs. There are two main approaches by which a website can be structured.

## Approaches to Website Structure

### Top-Down Approach

A top-down approach starts with the content’s general categories. By gradually breaking the content up into categories, you can logically divide it. The website’s taxonomy or hierarchical structure may be influenced by this.

### Bottom-Up Approach

The bottom-up approach is the opposite of the top-down approach. It prioritizes first creating a structure based on the content that is available for the website by grouping the elements into categories of the lowest level and then grouping these categories into higher-level ones.

## Types of Website Structures

There are various ways to organize the structure of your website. Here are some common types:

### 1. Hierarchical Model

A hierarchical structure with a single parent page (the main page) and child pages (categories and subcategories) that flow from the main page is the most common type of website structure.

### 2. Sequential Model

When you want your users to go through steps or any other sequence, this model is used. For example, guiding users through a sign-up process step by step.

### 3. Matrix Model

One of the earliest forms of website structure, the matrix model allows users to navigate via search or internal links rather than a predefined structure. It is commonly used in websites like Wikipedia.

### 4. Database Model

Sites with a lot of user-generated content, like blogs or forums, typically use this model. It organizes content dynamically based on metadata and other criteria.
